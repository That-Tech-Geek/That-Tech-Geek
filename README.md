# Hey, I'm That Tech Geek!
* Nah, I'm Sambit Mishra, and I am a curious soul who went from Science to Engineering to Economics, and now I'm learning to develop complex AI Models for economic and financial analysis
* I'm on LinkedIn as https://www.linkedin.com/in/thattechgeek/, so reach out to me, let's connect!
* Aside from my rather fickle study base, I am really into Chess, Badminton and Music.
* I'm always looking to learn more and more about everything, so if you think I have anything, *ANYTHING* you want to talk to me about, hit me up, and who knows, we'll kick it right off!
* That's about me. Sayonara!
